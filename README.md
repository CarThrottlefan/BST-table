# BST Implementation in C++

This is my way of creating a BST using classes. It takes an input a list of numbers, stop when the user inputs a letter and then converts that list into a
BST. Firstly, it displays the numbers in order, then it creates the visual representation of the BST via a table. The program also doesn't produce any
memory leaks, as that was one of the requirements.
